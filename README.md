# Haskell-word2vec

A haskell implementation of word2vec.

Specifically, an attempt at a direct port of (python gensim
word2vec)[https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/models/word2vec.py].
Direct, in this case, means reproducing the logging functionalities, function
and internal variable names. Due to that, some of the code is not very Haskelly,
nor is it optimized. That cleanup will come later.
